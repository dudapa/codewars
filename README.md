## About Codewars

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is a platform that offers coding challenges called Kata, created and contributed by the community. These challenges cover a wide range of difficulty levels and programming concepts, providing a great resource for improving coding skills.

## Project Structure

The project is organized by programming language, with subfolders for different difficulty levels (e.g., 6 kyu, 5 kyu, etc.). Inside these folders, you'll find individual files for each solved Codewars challenge, named according to the kata's title.


## How to Use

1. **Browse Solutions**: Navigate to the language and difficulty level folders to find specific solutions.
2. **Learn and Understand**: Review the code to understand the approach and implementation.
3. **Run the Code**: Run and test the code in your preferable Python or JavaScript environment

## Contribution Guidelines

If you'd like to contribute:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/fooBar).
3. Implement your changes.
4. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some fooBar').
5. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/fooBar).
